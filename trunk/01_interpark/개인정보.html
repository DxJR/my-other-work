	<p><b><u>Privacy Statement</u></b></p>
	<p><b>Date : June 28th, 2011</b></p>
	<ol>
		<li><b>Scope and  Changes</b><br>
			Interpark Global, Inc. and/or our subsidiaries (&quot;Interpark Global,&quot;  &quot;us&quot; or &quot;we&quot;) operate the websites&nbsp;<u>global.interpark.com</u>, <u>www.interpark.com</u> and  permutations of those sites, including certain co-branded versions of those  sites with third parties, that refer to this Website Privacy Statement in a  direct hyperlink (the &quot;Websites&quot;). Interpark Global respects your  privacy and we want you to be confident in sharing your information with us.  This Website Privacy Statement is designed to inform you of the types of  information we collect from users, how we use that information, and the  circumstances under which we will share it with third parties. This Website  Privacy Statement applies only to the Websites. It does not apply to your use  of any other websites (whether or not operated by us), including any websites  to which we provide links or websites of our partners or advertisers, or to any  activities which are not online.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Please note that some features and/or services referenced  may not be available on some Websites. Therefore, portions of this Website  Privacy Statement that pertain to such features or services may not be  applicable on each of the Websites.<br>
		This Website Privacy Statement is effective as of the  date listed above. Even if you read and/or agreed to a prior privacy statement,  you need to review this updated version. We reserve the right to revise this  Website Privacy Statement at any time and at our discretion. If we decide to  change our Website Privacy Statement, we will post those changes to this  Website Privacy Statement accessible on the homepages of the Websites, and  other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what  information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we  disclose it. If, however, we are going to use users' personally identifiable  information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, we  will notify users via either email or by posting a notice on the Websites for  30 days.</p>
	<ol>
		<li><b>Personal  Information and How We Use It</b><br>
			Generally, you may use some features of the Websites without providing us with  any personally identifiable information, but on some of our Websites, users  have the option of providing various personal information to make the best use  of available services and features and certain services and features require  that you provide personal information. This section describes what we collect  and how we use it. Providing your personal information is always voluntary, and  you can always choose not to provide your personal information by choosing not  to use the service or feature. By providing your personal information you  acknowledge and consent to our use of such information in accordance with this  statement.</li>
	</ol>
	<p><b>INFORMATION SUBMITTED BY YOU</b> </p>
	<p><b>Zip Code and Email Address:</b>&nbsp;On some of the Websites,  you have the choice of providing your ZIP Code or email address if, for  example, you would like to receive local services or information from us.</p>
	<p><b>Account or Profile Information:</b>&nbsp;On some of the Websites,  you may be able to become a registered user and create your user profile. When  you decide to become a registered user, we ask for some basic contact information,  such as a username and your ZIP Code and email address.? You also may choose to provide other  information about yourself, either as part of your public profile or otherwise,  such as your age, gender or interests. We may use the information that we  collect or receive to create a user profile in connection with your account. A  profile is stored information that we keep on individual users that detail  their viewing preferences, activities and interactions.</p>
	<p><b>Order and Account Related Information:</b>&nbsp;To purchase an item  through global.interpark.com, you will pay by using our online payment  processing service (our &quot;Payment Processing Service&quot;), and we will  collect your information that is needed to process the order, such as credit  card and related information like your billing address. Your credit card  information is not provided to the merchant. We will also collect information  that is needed for your order, such as your shipping address, the products that  you purchased, and the date on which you made and/or completed the order or  purchase.</p>
	<p><b>Customer Service:</b>&nbsp;You may elect to provide us with information  about your purchase, such as customer service requests or information about  merchant issues.</p>
	<p><b>Complete Contact Information:</b>&nbsp;If you wish to be  contacted by a merchant or service provider, we may collect your full name,  email address, phone number, as well as other information that may be  appropriate for the service, and we provide that information to the relevant  merchant(s) or service provider(s). We also may request that you complete a  questionnaire, which may require you to disclose personal financial, contact,  and other information that is relevant to the service (&quot;Service User  Information&quot;). You may elect not to provide Service User Information, in  which case you will not be able to receive the service.</p>
	<p><b>Content or Correspondence Submitted By You:</b>&nbsp;If you choose to post  content on any of the Websites where posting is available (for example, a  product or merchant review, or wish list), or submit personal correspondence to  Interpark Global, we may collect and maintain that information in a file specific  to you.</p>
	<p><b>Lists:</b>&nbsp;Some of the Websites allow you to create lists  of products that are interesting to you. The default for certain lists is for  the list to be publicly available. You may change the privacy setting of your  lists as provided on the Websites.</p>
	<p><b>Framing:</b>&nbsp;Please note that in some instances we utilize  framing techniques, which make it appear that you are on our site when you are  actually on a third party Web site.? The  privacy policy that governs the collection and use of the information will be present  on these pages so you always know whose privacy practices govern the collection  and use of the information that you submit.<br>
		<b>INFORMATION ACQUIRED AUTOMATICALLY</b><br>
		We collect certain information on the Websites through cookies, web beacons or  log files, and we receive information from third parties.</p>
	<p><b>Cookies and Web Beacons:</b>&nbsp;A cookie is a piece of  data tied to information about the user and stored on the user's computer. Web  beacons are similar in function to cookies and are used to track the online movements  of Web users. We use both session cookies, which terminate when a user closes  his browser, and persistent cookies, which remain on the user's computer until  manually deleted. We and/or our third party advertisers also use web beacons.</p>
	<p><b>Log Files:</b>&nbsp;Like most standard website servers we use log  files. Log files store information including internet protocol (IP) addresses,  browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform  type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks, and are used to analyze trends,  administer the Websites, track users' movement in the aggregate, and gather  broad demographic information for aggregate use. We use your IP address at  times to help identify you as you browse and to gather broad technical and demographic  information on who uses our Websites. We do not tie log files to personally  identifiable information.</p>
	<p><b>Third Party Information:</b>&nbsp;We may receive  information about you from other sources. For example, we may receive product  search or purchase information from merchants whose sites you visit after  clicking on a product listing on our site, updated delivery and address  information from shipping carriers or other third parties, updated or corrected  contact information from third party vendors, or credit or related information  as part of vendors¡¯ fraud detection services.</p>
	<p><b>PEOPLE UNDER 18 YEARS OLD</b> <br>
		Our Websites are not intended for use by people under  eighteen (18) years of age. If you are under 18, please do not send any  information to us. By accessing Websites or using our services, you represent  that you are 18 years of age or older.<br>
		<b>USES OF INFORMATION</b> <br>
		The information that we receive about users, including  profile information, allows us to provide a number of different services on the  Websites. For example:<br>
		We may use your email address to provide you with certain  information or updates (such as Price Alerts, our newsletters, or deals  notices) if requested by you, facilitate your provision of product or merchant  reviews.<br>
		We may use the account information to manage your  account, facilitate the use of certain features of our Websites (e.g.,  personalized product recommendations, suggestions of content that may be of  interest to you, submission of product/merchant reviews and creation of your  lists) and to send you information about our company, services and products.<br>
		We use cookies in a number of ways to make your use of  our services more enjoyable, useful and easy. We create cookie files on your  hard drive through your browser and use them, for example, to save information  on your Interpark Global username, ZIP Code and Website preferences so you can  avoid re-entry of this information each time you visit our Websites, and to  display certain usage information that may be helpful for you, such as your  recent searches and recently viewed items. Cookies also help us to deliver  content and advertisements specific to your interests. For example, we may use  cookies to collect anonymous information about your use of our sites and  services (including your browsing history, the terms you searched, the products  you viewed, etc.) and your interaction with our advertisements that are served  on the Websites or other sites. We also may allow our advertising partners to  use cookies to collect this kind of anonymous information. This information is  not associated with your personally identifiable information. We (or our  advertising partners) may use this anonymous use and browsing information to  customize your experience on the Websites, to improve the Websites and our  services such as by analyzing what content or services are helpful or  interesting to users, or to provide you with advertisements that are tailored  to your interests, both on our sites and on third-party sites. We also may  provide your anonymous use and browsing information to third parties to allow  them to provide you with advertisements that are tailored to your interests.  You may decline our cookies if your web browser software permits, although this  may prevent you from accessing certain features on our Websites.<br>
		Web beacons help us better manage content on our site by  informing us what content and which campaigns are effective. In addition, we  and our advertisers may use clear gifs in HTML-based emails. This allows us to  evaluate the effectiveness of our communications and our marketing campaigns by  showing how many emails recipients have opened. We also utilize web beacons to  enable Interpark Global or third parties to provide you with advertisements,  both on our sites and on third-party sites, that are tailored to your  interests. We do not tie web-beacons to personally identifiable information.<br>
		In addition to the uses described above, we may use your  personal information for any of the following:</p>
	<ol>
		<ol>
			<li>To contact you regarding the status of your inquiries relating to services  or products listed on our Websites.</li>
